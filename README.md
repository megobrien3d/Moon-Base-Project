# How to use 
Download all the files into the same directory. For a single simulation, type "MoonBaseTool" into MATLAB into the Command Window. Then insert the percent weight of the rocket that will be taken up by water, oxygen, food, and hydrogen, as well as the number of solar panels to consider as infrastructure already set up on the moon. Also input the number of people to be in the base (Size of Base). Then press "Go!".

Enter a number of days to progress and see the state of the various resources on the base on the right. The messages on the are arranged sequentially and correspond to changing states of the various resources. 

Use the pull-down menu to get a more in-depth analysis of the various resources.
